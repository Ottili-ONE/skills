# publish-reconcile-wp-meta

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when an agent must publish content to WordPress or Meta for
Ottili flows, or reconcile an unknown publish result. Do **not** use it for
general CMS logic, non-WordPress platforms, or non-Meta social platforms.

## Procedure

1. **Lookup first.** Ask the append-only idempotency store whether the
   client-generated key already maps to a post id. If yes, return it and
   never create a second post.
2. **Publish.** WordPress: `POST /wp/v2/posts` with Application Passwords or
   OAuth2 (Basic Auth is deprecated in WP 6.7+ core). Meta: `POST
   /{page-id}/feed` on the pinned Graph API version.
3. **Record.** On success, append the key → post id mapping to the store.
   Never mutate an entry in place.
4. **Handle errors.** 4xx blocks, except 409 (conflict → re-query by key).
   5xx retries with bounded exponential backoff. Auth errors never retry
   with the same token.
5. **Reconcile unknowns.** On a timeout or partial success, re-query both
   platforms by idempotency key, compare state, log the delta. Persistent
   mismatch → human review, never silent overwrite.
6. **SSRF-safe.** Publish only to the configured WP/Meta endpoints.

## Decision tables

### Error → fix (condensed)

| Status | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | Validation | Fix the named field |
| 401/403 | Auth | Re-issue credentials; never retry same token |
| 409 | Conflict / duplicate | Re-query by key; never re-create |
| 429 | Rate limited | Exponential backoff, up to 3 attempts |
| 5xx | Outage | Backoff; mark the post unknown |

### Reconcile outcome (condensed)

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Both platforms match | Ok; log |
| One platform newer | Re-query the older; log the delta |
| Unknown result (timeout) | Re-query both by key; log the delta |
| Persistent mismatch | Flag for human review; never silently overwrite |

## Pitfalls from research

- **POST is not idempotent by HTTP semantics.** Neither WP nor Meta natively
  supports idempotency keys, so the skill implements idempotency in the
  reconciliation layer.
- **WordPress Basic Auth is deprecated** as of WP 6.7+ (core). The separate
  plugin is unmaintained; use Application Passwords or OAuth2 instead.
- **Meta's pinned version is not the newest.** v19.0 is pinned, yet v20.0
  and v21.0 already appear in the changelog (re-verified 2026-10-09). Meta
  sunsets versions without notice; re-verify quarterly.
- **Never assume the first response is authoritative.** Neither API
  guarantees exactly-once delivery; re-query both platforms by the client
  idempotency key and compare state.
- **SSRF-safe.** Publish only to the configured WP/Meta endpoints; never
  publish to arbitrary hosts.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Idempotency key looked up in the store before every publish
- [ ] Duplicate key returns the existing post id (or 409 → re-query)
- [ ] WP uses Application Passwords or OAuth2 (not deprecated Basic Auth)
- [ ] Meta uses a page access token, pinned version
- [ ] 4xx treated as blocking (except 409); 5xx retried with backoff
- [ ] Unknown results re-queried by idempotency key; delta logged
- [ ] Publish target validated against the configured endpoints
- [ ] Idempotency store is append-only; no in-place mutation

## Near-miss triggers (stop and re-read)

- "I'll just POST again" → check the idempotency store first.
- "Basic Auth is fine, it's just a plugin" → deprecated in WP 6.7+ core.
- "v19.0 is the current Meta version" → v20.0 and v21.0 already exist.
- "The first response is authoritative" → re-query both platforms.
